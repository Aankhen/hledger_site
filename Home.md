Welcome to the hledger wiki!

Here you can find the User Cookbook and Dev Zone, complementing the main hledger docs on hledger.org.
You can find all content in the sidebar to the right.

Please edit and improve any of these pages and use this wiki freely.

### Editing help

- [Github wikis help](https://help.github.com/categories/wiki)
- edit by web, or by git clone/local edit/git push (editing requires a github account)
- linking between wiki pages: `[[Pagename]]` or `[[Link text|Pagename]]`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking from non-wiki to wiki pages: `https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/wiki/Pagename`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking to manuals: `http://hledger.org/manual#anchor`. anchor is any heading text, lowercased with punctuation removed and spaces replaced by hyphens.
- when renaming a page, try also to fix the links to it
- use the [_Sidebar](_Sidebar/_edit) to organize content. This is mirrored to the main [docs page](http://hledger.org/docs) hourly.
- Dev Zone content is in the dev/ subdirectory. It has its own _Sidebar, which can only be edited via git. "dev/" does not appear in wiki links or urls.
