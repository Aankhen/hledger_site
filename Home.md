Welcome to the hledger wiki!
This complements the main documentation at [hledger.org/docs](http://hledger.org/docs.html).

You are encouraged to edit and update any of these pages through the web, 
or by git clone/edit locally/git push. Editing requires a github account.

Some ways to use it:

- capture quick notes, when you don't want to figure out where it belongs in the main docs, submit a pull request, etc.

- draft new docs here and maybe move to the main website later

- move docs that don't fit on the website back here

- create pages annotating/discussion specific sections of the main docs (eg [[Queries]])
