Welcome to the hledger wiki! 

This complements the main hledger website and the reference manuals on [hledger.org](http://hledger.org)
with additional docs, which can be edited more quickly:

- the User Cookbook - how-tos, tutorials, examples, notes..
- the Dev Zone - developer notes, contributor guide..

You can find all content via the sidebar to the right.

### Editing help

This is your wiki! Please edit, improve and use it freely.

- [Github wikis help](https://help.github.com/categories/wiki)
- editing requires a github account
- edit by web, or by git clone, local edit, git push
- link between wiki pages: `[[Pagename]]` or `[[Other text|Pagename]]`. 
Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- link to wiki pages from elsewhere: `https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/wiki/Pagename`. 
Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- link to hledger manual sections: `http://hledger.org/manual#anchor`. 
anchor is any manual heading's text, lowercased with punctuation removed and spaces replaced by hyphens.
- when renaming a page, try also to update the links to it
- use the [_Sidebar](_Sidebar/_edit) to organize content. 
This is mirrored to the main [docs page](http://hledger.org/docs) hourly.
We might include some external (non-wiki) links here, italicised.
- Dev Zone content is in the dev/ subdirectory. 
It has its own _Sidebar, which can only be edited via git. 
The subdirectory "dev/" does not appear in wiki links or urls. 
Page names should be unique across all directories.
Pages created through the web are always in the top directory; they can be moved into dev/ with git.
