Welcome to the hledger wiki!

This complements the main hledger docs at http://hledger.org/docs.html. 
You can edit through the web, or clone and edit locally, if you have a github account.
Some ways to use it:

- capture quick notes, when you don't want to figure out where it belongs in the main docs, submit a pull request, etc.

- draft new docs here and maybe move to the main website later

- create pages annotating/discussion specific sections of the main docs (eg [[Queries]])
