You can find all content via the sidebar to the right.

### Editing help

Content is hosted here for quicker editing. Please edit, improve and use the wiki freely.

- [Github wikis help](https://help.github.com/categories/wiki)
- edit by web, or by git clone/local edit/git push (editing requires a github account)
- linking between wiki pages: `[[Pagename]]` or `[[Link text|Pagename]]`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking from non-wiki to wiki pages: `https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/wiki/Pagename`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking to manuals: `http://hledger.org/manual#anchor`. anchor is any heading text, lowercased with punctuation removed and spaces replaced by hyphens.
- when renaming a page, try also to fix the links to it
- use the [_Sidebar](_Sidebar/_edit) to organize content. This is mirrored to the main [docs page](http://hledger.org/docs) hourly.
- Dev Zone content is in the dev/ subdirectory. It has its own _Sidebar, which can only be edited via git. "dev/" does not appear in wiki links or urls.
