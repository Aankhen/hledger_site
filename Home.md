Welcome to the hledger wiki!
This complements the main documentation at [hledger.org/docs](http://hledger.org/docs.html).
You can find all content in the sidebar to the right.

You are encouraged to edit and improve any of these pages. Some ways to use the wiki:

- capture quick notes, without needing a pull request

- draft new docs, eg how-tos complementing the reference manuals

- create pages to annotate/discuss specific sections of the main docs (eg [[Queries]])

More wiki help:
- [Github wikis help](https://help.github.com/categories/wiki)
- edit by web, or by git clone/local edit/git push (editing requires a github account)
- linking between wiki pages: `[[Pagename]]` or `[[Link text|Pagename]]`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking from non-wiki to wiki pages: `https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/wiki/Pagename`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking to manuals: `http://hledger.org/manual#anchor`. anchor is any heading text, lowercased with punctuation removed and spaces replaced by hyphens.
- after renaming a page, try also to fix the links to it
- use the [_Sidebar](_Sidebar/_edit) to organize content. This is mirrored to the main [docs page](http://hledger.org/docs) hourly.
