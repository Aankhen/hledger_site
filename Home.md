Welcome to the hledger wiki!

Here you can find the User Cookbook and Dev Zone, complementing the main hledger docs on hledger.org.
You can find all content in the sidebar to the right.

### Use this wiki

Please edit and improve any of these pages and use this wiki freely. Some ideas:

- capture quick notes, without needing a pull request

- draft new docs, eg how-tos complementing the reference manuals

- create pages to annotate/discuss specific sections of the main docs (eg [[Queries]])

### Editing help

- [Github wikis help](https://help.github.com/categories/wiki)
- edit by web, or by git clone/local edit/git push (editing requires a github account)
- linking between wiki pages: `[[Pagename]]` or `[[Link text|Pagename]]`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking from non-wiki to wiki pages: `https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/wiki/Pagename`. Pagename is case insensitive and can have spaces.
- linking to manuals: `http://hledger.org/manual#anchor`. anchor is any heading text, lowercased with punctuation removed and spaces replaced by hyphens.
- when renaming a page, try also to fix the links to it
- use the [_Sidebar](_Sidebar/_edit) to organize content. This is mirrored to the main [docs page](http://hledger.org/docs) hourly.
