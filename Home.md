Welcome to the hledger wiki!
This complements the main documentation at [hledger.org/docs](http://hledger.org/docs.html).

You are encouraged to edit and update any of these pages through the web (requires a github account).
Or by git clone-ing this wiki, edit locally, git push (requires repo collaborator access, ask for this if you need it *right ? please update this note*).

Some ways to use it:

- capture quick notes, when you don't want to figure out where it belongs in the main docs, submit a pull request, etc.

- draft new docs here and maybe move to the main website later

- move docs that don't fit on the website back here

- create pages annotating/discussion specific sections of the main docs (eg [[Queries]])

- wiki links: `[[WikiPage]]` or `[[Link Text|WikiPage]]`, WikiPage is case insensitive
