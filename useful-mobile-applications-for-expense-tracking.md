I find tracking expenses using a mobile device convenient. One of the challenges has been finding applications that focus primarily on this. Do add ones with a brief description you find useful.

1. [expense](http://ela.build/expense) (iOS)
   * minimal interface only for expense tracking. CSV export supported

0. [XpenseTracker, BizXpenseTracker](http://www.silverwaresoftware.com/XpenseTracker.html) (iOS)
   * comprehensive and serviceable money & time tracking apps.
[CSV rules](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/examples/csv/xpensetracker.csv.rules).
