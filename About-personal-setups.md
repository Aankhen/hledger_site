hledger and plain text accounting tools generally are highly flexible
and don't impose much structure or process. This can make it hard to
get started.

In this part of the site, you can read about some of the file
organisations, workflows and routines that have been effective for
other hledger users. You may like to try replicating one of these
exactly, or simply read for ideas.

Once you have had some success with hledger, feel free to add a page,
or several, describing your setup or workflows (the two usually go
together). These docs are not required to be complete, reproducible,
or maintained (though those things are nice!), but they should give
some insight into a real-world setup that you found useful.

Here's a rough template to consider as a starting point:
