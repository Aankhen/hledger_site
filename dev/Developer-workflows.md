### Get developer tools

Ensure [`stack`](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started) is installed
(or if youâ€™re a [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) expert, feel free to use that.)

Ensure [`git`](http://git-scm.com) is installed. On Windows, it comes with stack.

Here are some useful optional tools:

- [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make): to use the convenient [Make rules](#make).
- [`entr`](http://www.entrproject.org/) runs arbitrary commands when files change.
- [`ghcid`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid) gives real-time GHC feedback as you make code changes.
- [`shelltestrunner`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/shelltestrunner) runs hledger's functional tests.
- [`quickbench`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickbench) measures and reports time taken by commands.
- [`hasktags`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasktags) generates tag files for quick code navigation in editors like Emacs and vim.
- For browsing and editing Haskell code, popular tools include: Emacs, Vim, IDEA, VS Code, Atom..

Eg:

    stack install ghcid shelltestrunner quickbench hasktags
    brew install entr

### Get the code

    git clone https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger
    cd hledger

### Review code

- review and discuss new [pull requests](http://prs.hledger.org) and commits on github
- build hledger and test the latest changes in your own repo
- read the existing [code docs and source](#quick-links)
- send feedback or discuss via [IRC or mail list](/docs.html#helpfeedback)

### Build in place

See also http://hledger.org/download.html#c.-build-the-development-version .

    stack build    # hledger hledger-ui ...

This fetches the required GHC version and haskell dependencies from the default stackage snapshot (configured in `stack.yaml`), 
then builds all hledger packages.
This can take a while! To save time, you can build individual packages, eg just the CLI and TUI.

Note stack does not fetch C libraries such as curses or terminfo, which you might need to install yourself, using your system's package manager.
In case of trouble, see [download](/download.html#link-errors).

If you want to use an older snapshot/GHC for some reason, specify one of the older stack-ghc*.yaml files:

    stack --stack-yaml stack-ghc8.2.yaml build
    
### Run in place

    stack exec -- hledger     # ARGS...
    stack exec -- hledger-ui  # ARGS...
    stack exec -- which hledger

### Build and install

This builds and also copies the hledger executables to `~/.local/bin` or the Windows equivalent
(which you should  [add to your `$PATH`](/download.html#b)).

    stack install    # hledger hledger-ui ...

### Run package tests

Runs any HUnit/doctest/easytest tests defined by each hledger package.

    stack test    # hledger ...

### Run package benchmarks

Runs any performance reports defined by each hledger package.

    stack bench    # hledger ...

### Run quickbench benchmarks

Times the end-user commands in `bench.sh` using quickbench.

    make bench

### Run functional tests

Runs the shelltestrunner tests defined in tests/, which test the hledger CLI.

    stack build hledger
    make functest

### Run haddock tests

Checks for anything that would break haddock doc generation.

    make haddocktest

### Simulate Travis tests

Locally runs tests similar to what we run on Travis CI.

    make travistest

### Test with all supported GHC versions/stackage snapshots

    make allsnapshotstest

### Use GHCI

GHCI is GHC's REPL, useful for exploring and calling code interactively.

#### Get a GHCI prompt for hledger-lib:

    cd hledger-lib; stack ghci hledger-lib

Changing into the package directory isn't actually needed, but it
enables a custom .ghci script which sets a more useful short prompt.

#### Get a GHCI prompt for hledger:

    cd hledger; stack ghci hledger

#### Get a GHCI prompt for hledger-ui:

    cd hledger-ui; stack ghci hledger-ui

#### Get a GHCI prompt for hledger-web:

    cd hledger-web; stack ghci hledger-web

hledger-web also needs to find some things in its current directory (like the static/ directory).
This normally just works, if not please [send details](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/274).

### Add a test

- identify what to test
- choose the test type: unit ? functional ? benchmark ?
- currently expected to pass or fail ?
- figure out where it goes
- write test, verify expected result
- get it committed

### Fix a bug or add a feature

- research, discuss, validate the issue/feature on irc/list/bug tracker
- look for related tests, run the tests and check they are passing
- add a test ?
- develop a patch
- include any related issue numbers in the patch name, eg: "fix for blah blah (#NNN)"
- get it committed

### Get your changes accepted

Follow the usual github workflow:

- fork the main hledger repo on github,
- git clone it to your local machine,
- git commit, after (?) pulling and merging the latest upstream changes
- git push back to github,
- open a pull request on github,
- follow up on any discussion there.

If you're new to this process, [help.github.com](http://help.github.com) may be useful.

### Add yourself to the contributor list

- after getting something into the master branch, read and sign the [contributor list & agreement](contributors.html). Or, [ask](/docs.html#helpfeedback) to be added.
- give yourself a high five!

### Work on docs

Most docs tasks are handled by [[Shake]]. 

#### List Shake rules:

    ./Shake

#### Generate man/info/txt manuals (in hledger*/) and embed in hledger executables:

    ./Shake manuals
    stack build

#### Generate html manuals and the hledger website (in site/_site/):

    ./Shake website

#### To remove all files generated by Shake:

    ./Shake Clean

### Use ghcid for rapid feedback from GHC

[ghcid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghcid) is the most reliable and fastest way to see GHC's feedback, and optionally run tests or a GHCI command, as you edit.

Some make rules are provided to make running it easier. Run `make` to see a list. These cause ghcid to watch multiple packages rather than just one. 

#### Watch for compile errors in hledger-lib and hledger:

    make ghcid

#### Watch compile errors and the output of some hledger command:

    ghcid -c 'make ghci' -T ':main -f a.j bal --budget -N'

### Use entr for rapid feedback from arbitrary commands

[entr](http://entrproject.org/) is the most robust cross-platform tool for watching files and running a command when they change. Note its first argument must be an executable program, to run a shell command or multiple commands use `bash -c "..."`.

#### Rerun a single functional test as you change it:

    ls tests/budget/budget.test | entr bash -c 'clear; COLUMNS=80 stack exec -- shelltest --execdir tests/budget/budget.test -i12'
