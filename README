This is hledger_site, the repo for the hledger.org website.
It contains most of the source files for the hledger.org website.

This repo was created in 2019 by combining the site/ subfolder
previously in the main hledger repo, and the github wiki, preserving
the essential histories of both (though for the true original history
of site/ up to 2019/08, see the main hledger repo.)

It is intended to be cloned as the "site" subdirectory of the main
hledger repo. Currently this is done manually, not via git submodule
or subtree.

Some hledger docs kept in the main hledger repo - user manuals,
developer docs - are included in the website via symbolic links to the
parent directory. README.md is one of these, and does not pertain to
this directory, though Github shows it as if it did.

Site building scripts are in the main hledger repo (mostly in
Shake.hs), and should be run from there, not from here. Eg:

hledger$ make Shake      # compile Shake.hs before using it
hledger$ ./Shake website # generate the website in site/_site/
