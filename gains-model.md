### A model for capital gains

Capital gain/loss (when the value of assets you hold increases/decreases
due to market price fluctuations) - is an important topic, since it can
generate tax liability.

Here is a description of how it works, intended for both users and
builders of accounting software (especially, plain text accounting
software).

By training I'm a software engineer, not an accountant. In places there
may be better accounting terms I'm not familiar with yet.

1.  lots/units

2.  lot acquisition and disposal

3.  deposits, withdrawals, multi-lot balances

4.  unrealised capital gain

5.  realised capital gain

6.  lot withdrawal strategies

7.  specific identification
