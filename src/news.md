## This Week In Hledger 2023-11-03

### sm
#### Dev
- tests: add outshine headings for folding/readability (in Emacs),
  readme updates, include .test files in TAGS, clean up ledger-compat tests
- tools: bake dbgstrs - print a bunch of hledger debug messages for review
- tools: ghci :rmain - like :main, but reloads first, useful eg when changing --debug level
- WIP: imp: prices: fixes, clarify/improve semantics
- WIP: precisiongeddon: precision/rounding cleanups/fixes/tests/docs, too intricate to describe

Continuing heavy work on consistent and optimal precision handling,
and all the related yaks which keep showing up.

#### Seen
- https://www.chvp.be/blog/nanoledger/ nice blog post introducing nanoledger android app

### sm

#### Dev

- demo: avoid a bug in asciinema 2.3.0, and improve the error message when asciinema fails (#2094)
- web: fix broken "File format help" link in the edit form (#2103)
- web: access control UX cleanups: replace --capabilities and --capabilities-header with --allow, and validate it before starting the app (#834)
- web: refactor permission checking
- web: sandstorm web app cleanups; rename/reorder roles & permissions
- WIP: testing and improving amount style and precision handling in cost/value reports

#### Ops

- Set up a self-hosted Sandstorm server and learned how to configure it.
- Set up a public hledger-web instance in it: sandbox.hledger.org.
  Unlike <https://demo.hledger.org>, and until the spammers find it,
  sandbox is fully writable - use it as a pastebin for examples, eg.

#### Docs

- Contemplating: merging cookbook and examples/*; something more custom to replace mdbook

#### Examples

- hledger-report1: a custom compound report script, haskell and bash versions

#### Misc

- exploring latest Paisa, and how to use it with existing setups

#### Seen

- <https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/17g0026/average_cost_capital_gains_with_hledger>
  very clear tutorial posts on (one way of) tracking investments

- *The primary reason Ledger was created was because it maintains the
  double-entry accounting equation for you: all accounts must
  balance. GUI tools never did this aggressively enough, all of them
  having some kind of feature like "check accounts" that would end up
  finding unaccountable pennies here or there.* --John Wiegley,

### chvp

- A new Android app, NanoLedger,  was added to F-droid to facilitate adding transactions on the fly. 
  Payees, notes and accounts can all be autocompleted. 
  Give it a try at <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/be.chvp.nanoledger/>

## This Week In Hledger 2023-10-20

G'day @room. It's time for This Week In Hledger ! 
Every Friday morning, if you have any user or dev news or experiences you'd like to share, post them in the hledger matrix chat  (<https://matrix.to/#/#hledger:matrix.org>) as a message prefixed by "TWIH:". Markdown formatting and edits are welcome. On Saturday I'll publish on the hledger mail list and on mastodon.
  
### sm

Changes merged this week include:

#### Dev

- print: add --round option for more control of precisions (#2085)
- balance-assigned amounts affect commodity styles again (#2091, regression in 1.30)
- timedot: parse unitful quantities more accurately (#2096)
- Jacob Weisz has updated the hledger-web app on Sandstorm 
  (The amazing [https://sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io/) cloud app platform that lets you set up free private hledger-web instances with a few clicks, check it out!)

#### Ops

- renamed main CI workflow and branch to "ci"
- updated and committed hledger.org's caddy config and short urls (redirects)
- there's now an easy short url for trying out the hledger-web app on Sandstorm: <https://sandstorm.hledger.org>.

#### Docs

- moved regression bounty info to <https://hledger.org/REGRESSIONS.html>
- hledger manual > Journal > Commodity display style: rewritten
- hledger manual > aregister, hledger-ui manual > Register screen: note how separately-dated postings get combined

#### Examples
- justfile: forecast-import: show but don't consume future-dated forecast transactions

### Robert Nielsen

<https://hledgerfan.com/a-not-so-capital-idea-for-saving-time/> describes a timesaving tip for command line users. Specifically, when typing one of your account names, hledger "forgives" you if you don't match the capitalization of an account name.

### danielchappell

#### What I like about the data format
- Double Entry accounting in human readable files, the journal files.
- Balance assignments (to check in on my cash-wallet occasionally)
- Virtual transactions (to track funds)

#### What I like about HLedger specifically
- static analysis cf.Â [https://hledger.org/hledgermatic.html](https://hledger.org/hledgermatic.html)

#### What I need to do my homework on
- The limitations of balance assertions in HLedger
- study haskell

#### What makes me cry about HLedger
- A lack of amount expressions - github issue #183, [https://hledger.org/ledger.html?highlight=expression#amount-expressions](https://hledger.org/ledger.html?highlight=expression#amount-expressions)
