**Quotes**

*Been using ledger and hledger for about four years, love them
dearly. I find ledger + Emacs ledger-mode the most convenient for
daily use. Hledger has a somewhat nicer way of formatting reports on
the CLI, making it useful for creating ad-hoc reports and digging into
your data. --compns8-ng*

*I've been using hledger ... [it] has more features like balance sheet,
income statement generation with a plain text file for the last 3
years and it's been working out great. --rwbt*

**Quotes**

- *Way less painful than QuickBooks if you're also a programmer or adjacent. --dmoy*

- *My favorite part of the (extensive) Haskell API is `Hledger.Cli.Script`. It re-exports all the most commonly used functions and data types, meaning you're just one import away from everything you need to get started.--wbadart*

I fixed some doc issues on hledger.org: code blocks can now be scrolled normally, and are cheerily color-coded instead of drab grey.
The 1.33 release is still pending. Another gnarly release blocker remains to fix,
and I was burned out on those.
Instead, got deeply involved in setting up a new site for PTA discussions, <https://forum.plaintextaccounting.org>.

## This Week In Hledger 2024-01-12

**sm:**
This week I worked mostly on support and thinking/writing about improvements to `close` and the new file/periodic files workflow.
I introduced some new terminology to distinguish *starting/ending files* vs *opening/closing accounts*, which are unrelated events.
I added new `--assert` and `--assign` modes to `close` and clarified a problem with using balance assignments for starting balances.
I reviewed status and proposed some changes at [Better UX around starting and ending files ? #2151](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2151) -
please take a look and give your thoughts if you're interested in this.

Over on <https://plaintextaccounting.org> I checked and fixed the remaining broken links;
and surveyed and linked all the hledger and PTA [videos](https://plaintextaccounting.org/#videos) visible on youtube (they're fun, check them out).

**nobodyinperson:**
TWIH: I published annextimelog v0.10.1 and it's now in a state I would cautiously call useable for something practical as one can now record, delete and also edit logged time periods.
It's a cli git-annex based time tracker focusing on conflict-free syncing between devices and flexible tagging. 
It has timeclock output so can be piped into hledger, e.g.
```
atl ls -a project=hledger -O timeclock | hledger -f timeclock:- bal -D
```

**Quotes**

- *Plain-text accounting is great. I choose hledger for the accounts of a small side business that doesn't warrant hiring an accountant.*

- *I love hledger and have a few scripts to convert downloaded CSVs from various institutions into the appropriate format and dedupe any overlap if necessary.
Once a month I download a bunch of statements, run a script and have all of the data available to me.*

## This Week In Hledger 2023-12-29

**sm:**
Fixed a tricky csv rule parsing regression [#2134](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2134) and a debug logging bug.

Improved the project Justfile, improved docs.
I also improved and "described" my time and task tracking dashboard;
see <https://hledger.org/time-and-task-dashboard.html>.
(Please accept Mr. Goldberg's excellent diagram until I have time to make my own.)

And the usual support and online chatter.

**Robert Nielsen:**

**Misc:**
Lots of reddit posts this week, including some hledger-related ones:

- [Is there any plain text accounting software which uses standard debits and credits?](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/18sbmsx/is_there_any_plain_text_accounting_software_which/)

- [Help migrating my personal budget system](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/18g4lmz/help_migrating_my_personal_budget_system/)

And also some lively discussion on the [mail list](https://list.hledger.org),
including this [proposal](https://groups.google.com/g/hledger/c/aZXoDSQW1xk/m/vV2T_HGDAgAJ) to simplify file opening and closing balances.

**Quotes:**
*The main thing that made me switch to hledger was the ease of autogenerating transactions into a plain-text format. ...
GNUCash made recurring transactions easy but made it a lot harder to generate split transactions according to fixed splits that I regularly engage with my friends/family in.
With hledger I have a system of taking CSVs, classifying transactions using a stack of Python scripts and using them to generate hledger importable files. 
I go by hand and annotate transactions that my scripts couldn't classify/split, and then I import it into my main hledger file. 
I store all my inputs and intermediate imports in a git repository along with my main ledger file for auditability and to look at annotations. 
The ease of automation just can't be beat with PTA but it's definitely harder to use if you don't have a preference for TUI work.
Ease of writing importers was a huge driving factor when I switched to hledger from GNUCash.*

## This Week In Hledger 2023-12-22

**sm:**
This week I worked more on consolidating project scripts, porting make rules to just.
Also participated in timeclock discussions, did some research and brainstormed next steps.

**nobodyinperson:**
I published annextimelog v0.3.1, a git-annex based time tracker (alpha quality, bare minimum functionality),
which can export its data to hledger-readable timeclock.

<https://pypi.org/project/annextimelog>

**Robert Nielsen:**
On the hledger fan website I look at using desc as a timesaver, and why this matters: <https://hledgerfan.com/a-better-description>

**Misc:**
ShrykeWindgrace's PR upgrading hledger-ui to the new brick and vty libs has landed;
hledger-ui now runs natively on Microsoft Windows.

**Quotes of the week:**
*I’ve been using hledger for a few years. ... Every service lets you download historical data as CSV, 
which can be imported by hledger and turned into journal files and then into visual reports. ...
It’s a bespoke setup and super nerdy and is a bit of a pain, but it’s literally the only solution that works for us.*

*Share your hledger/PTA user notes, dev news, achievements or experiences 
in the hledger matrix chat, every Friday morning (or any time, tagged with "TWIH").*

**sm:**

Dev:

Fixes:

- Non-print-like reports no longer add trailing decimal marks (a regression in 1.31).
  Clarified the policy on number formatting adjustments made in certain reports/output formats. (#2115)
- `tag:` queries now work when reading CSV files. (#2114)
- `-o`/`--outputfile` with a .json or .sql extension now properly selects those formats.

Improvements/features:

- The `print` command has a new `beancount` output format for exporting to Beancount.
- Timedot format supports a new letters syntax for easier tagged time logging. (#2116)
- Journal format now accepts lot costs with spaces after `{`, improving Ledger compatibility.

Docs:

hledger: added "Amount formatting, parseability",
updated "Decimal marks, digit group marks", "commodity directive", "CSV > if table", "Timedot".

Ledger: added more notes on commodity directives, from chat.

Checking for errors: added tips on enforcing account lifetimes, from reddit,
and on minimising diffs in reports, from mail list.

Cookbook: added "Reporting version control stats".

Over at <https://plaintextaccounting.org/#articles-blog-posts> I started
adding blog links for 2021-2023, including ~~10~~ 33 hledger-related posts
from Robert Nielsen, Jonathan Dowland, Arsen Arsenović, and Zoran Zaric.

Misc:

Updated project finance scripts, regenerated the project ledger with
consistent precisions in assertions, updated it with the last few
months of data from Open Collective.

**Robert Nielsen:**
On the theme of the recent Thanksgiving Day, here are three ways you
can use hledger to be thankful:
<https://hledgerfan.com/using-hledger-for-thanksgiving/>.

**Quotes of the week:**
*Have been taking care of my (new) records for almost two years now
and this data is really valuable for me. Gives me very nice overview
over everything and confidence that everything is alright and so on.
Just looking at some graphs can make you feel really good - in terms
of "I know whats happening", not necessarily in "all is well",
depending on those actual numbers! 😆* --someone using Beancount

## This Week In Hledger 2023-11-17

Every Friday morning (or any time, tagged with "TWIH"):
share your hledger/plain text accounting user notes, dev news,
achievements or experiences in the hledger matrix chat.

**sm:**

Dev

A new hledger user pointed out in chat out that -s/--strict mode
didn't work with the import command. This exposed a bug (#2113) and
led to some reworking of the API in Hledger.Read. Until now, when
reading multiple files, -s/--strict checks were performed for each
individual file, causing spurious failures, with import and other
commands.  Now strict checks are done only once, for the overall
journal.  Also, the import command now only updates .latest files at
the end of a successful run (after successfully passing strict checks
and after updating the journal file).

Post-"Precisiongeddon" followup: updating hledger-ui and hledger-web
to show amounts with correct display precision.

Ops

Fixed a problem with cloudflare authentication that was preventing
automatic TLS certificate renewal on hledger.org.

Clarified and documented my cloudflare tokens, and moved them to env
vars so the latest caddy config could be committed.

Fixed the hledger.org webhook that was not updating the site on git push.

Enabled https for "code.hledger.org" and "site.hledger.org" short urls.

Fixed some caddy warnings, formatted the config file, added some
caddy/webhook management scripts to the site makefile.

Docs

Spent some time drafting alternate hledger manual structures and
thinking about adding a user guide.

Misc

Time breakdown this week: 52% enhancement, 35% cleanup, 13% support.

**Robert Nielsen:**
On the hledger fan website, I discuss using the aregister and print
commands to get narrow and wider views of your data:
<https://hledgerfan.com/zooming-out-and-in>

**Quotes of the week:**

*Great software btw, I appreciate your work! Been poking around with
PTA and hledger since I was laid off, and it's been incredible for
managing/extending my runway 😁 I was a Mint/Personal Capital power
user before, but this takes it to the next level. Got a new job and
I've already forecasted out the whole next year, very handy and
something I could never do before"*

*I spent some time trying to set up hledger so that I’d actually use
it.  With multiple accounts it really got tedious but I loved the
actual double entry accounting and level of detail.  My wife was blown
away by the year end summary I made with it. You can see early how
much went to taxes, fica etc etc.*

*I'm really happy how my hledger edit addon helps me quickly reconcile
transactions. After CSV-importing from all different sources (phone
notes, bank websites, etc.), I pile up the ridiculous amount of
invoices and receipts next to me, grab one after the other and execute
hledger edit amt:35.11 or hledger edit Checking desc:ALDI for example
to find and edit the transaction in my $EDITOR, no matter where that
txn was located originally.  The other way round (going through the
journal, then finding the physical invoice/receipt) turned out to be
much slower.*

*I learned one thing: `if %FIELDNAME REGEX` matches against FIELDNAME
in the CSV. I didn't know that! I always match against the whole line
and am annoyed if the order of columns makes this weird*

## This Week In Hledger 2023-11-10

It's time for This Week In Hledger!
Every Friday morning (or any time, tagged with "TWIH"), share your hledger/PTA user notes, 
dev news, achievements or experiences in the hledger matrix chat.

**sm:**

Dev

This week I completed the months-long yak shave that became Precisiongeddon, and it has landed in master;
see <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/2111> for details.
Heads up: this can change default precisions shown especially by cost and value reports - 
all for the better hopefully, but any pre-release testing is welcome. 
There's a linux binary at <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/actions/runs/6804488282>.

CI (continuous integration) workflows on github have been optimised a bit:
- Scheduled weekly builds have been disabled, as they were propagating
  to forks and running wastefully there in some cases.
- Some repeated rebuilding of the hledger-lib and hledger packages
  that seems unnecessary has been stopped.
- hledger-ui no longer builds its modules twice.
- Haddock testing has been moved to the release workflows to save time.

Fixed:
- amounts in value reports can sometimes be shown unstyled / with zero decimal digits,
  <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2105>
- auto postings break redundant equity/cost detection and transaction balancing,
  <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2110>
  
My time log for the week shows 69% enhancement, 27% cleanup, 5% support.

Docs

As part of Precisiongeddon, I started expanding hledger's "code docs", in the Hledger module's haddock.
I spent time learning how to navigate Haddock and producing a fast-feedback authoring workflow (`make haddock-watch`).
And documented a bunch of "jargon" terms, and how we handle precision and display styles.

The "Regular expressions" manual section has been rewritten and now has examples:
<https://hledger.org/dev/hledger.html#regular-expressions>.

Unmentioned last week: I added a News page on hledger.org as a stable home
for This Week In Hledger and other news updates.

Misc

Some notable commits:
- feat: cli: Add tsv output (#869) (Peter Sagerson)
- feat: import: interpolate regex matches in field templates (#2009) (Jonathan Dowland)

There's new interest and design discussion for referencing the matched account name
in auto postings, and I have added to lukasbestle's $20 bounty to make it $100:
<https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1975>

**Quotes of the week:**

*Overall very happy with hledger so far btw!*

*And thanks for the amazing tool. Migrating to hledger has been one of the most satisfying bits of digital homesteading I’ve done.*
