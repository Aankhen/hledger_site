More notes related to [currency conversion](currency-conversion.md).

In a currency conversion or a stock purchase/sale, one commodity is exchanged for another.
In plain text accounting, there are two ways to record such conversions:

## 1. Equity method

Balance both commodities against an Equity account. Eg:

<!-- 1a.j -->
```journal
2021-01-01
  assets:usd                -1.20 USD
  equity:conversion          1.20 USD
  equity:conversion         -1.00 EUR
  assets:eur                 1.00 EUR
```

or, equivalently:

<!-- 1b.j -->
```journal
2021-01-01
  assets:usd                -1.20 USD
  assets:eur                 1.00 EUR
  equity:conversion
```

## 2. Conversion price method

PTA tools provide the @ (or @@) notation for specifying a conversion price
(essentially; Ledger/Beancount also provide an alternate {} notation):

<!-- 2a.j -->
```journal
2021-01-01
  assets:usd                -1.20 USD
  assets:eur                 1.00 EUR @ 1.20 USD
```

@-priced amounts (the 1.00 EUR above) will be converted to their price's commodity (USD)

- internally for checking transaction balancedness, always
- and visibly in reports, when the `-B/--cost` flag is used.

Note the redundancy in this entry; the two amounts and the @ price must agree. 
This provides some extra error checking, but you can also write it non-redundantly, 
by omitting an amount:

<!-- 2b.j -->
```journal
2021-01-01
  assets:usd                           ; the -1.20 USD amount is inferred
  assets:eur                 1.00 EUR @ 1.20 USD
```

or the conversion price:

<!-- 2c.j -->
```journal
2021-01-01
  assets:usd                -1.20 USD
  assets:eur                 1.00 EUR  ; the @ 1.20 USD price is inferred
```

## Pros and Cons

### Cost reporting

The @ (conversion price) method allows "cost" reporting. By adding the
`-B/--cost` flag you can easily see what things cost (or were sold
for) in the other commodity. Eg:

```cli
$ hledger -f 2a.j bal --cost assets:eur
            1.20 USD  assets:eur
--------------------
            1.20 USD  
```

This kind of report is not possible with the equity method, currently.

### Gain/loss reporting

The equity method keeps a trace of all commodity exchanges in the equity account,
in effect properly recording the accumulated gain/loss from all commodity exchanges
(it can be seen by valuing the accumulated total of those equity balances in some commodity).

The @ method does not record the gain/loss from commodity exchanges
(at least, not so explicitly and not grouped by commodity pair.
We can still calculate it using hledger valuation features like -V, --valuechange, --gain.)

### Balanced accounts

The equity method keeps accounts and the accounting equation (A+L+E=0)
balanced. See how it keeps the balance report's total as zero:

```cli
$ hledger -f 1a.j bal
            1.00 EUR  assets:eur
           -1.20 USD  assets:usd
           -1.00 EUR
            1.20 USD  equity:conversion
--------------------
                   0  
```

The @ method causes unbalanced accounts and a non-zero total
(because of the "magical" transformation from one commodity to the other):

```cli
$ hledger -f 2a.j bal
            1.00 EUR  assets:eur
           -1.20 USD  assets:usd
--------------------
            1.00 EUR
           -1.20 USD  
```

The zero total can be seen only if all amounts are converted to cost:

```cli
$ hledger -f 2a.j bal --cost
            1.20 USD  assets:eur
           -1.20 USD  assets:usd
--------------------
                   0  
```

### Summary

The equity method: 

- doesn't support cost reporting.

The @ method:

- doesn't support easy gain/loss reporting by commodity pair.
- doesn't maintain balanced accounts

## Improvement proposals

The two methods of recording conversions were discussed mostly at
<https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1177> in 2020.

### 1554

<https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/1554> was proposed in 2021.
Here's an attempted summary:

#### Goals / problems tackled

1. Allow entries written with the @ style to be converted on the fly to equity
   style when appropriate.
2. Allow all three of cost reporting, gain/loss reporting, and balanced accounts.
3. Reduce required data entry effort.
   
#### Current draft docs

> \# COSTING
>
> The `--cost=TYPE` option and the `-B` flag control how hledger handles any
> [costs](#costs) which are specified.
>
> `-B / --cost / --cost=cost`
> : Convert amounts to their cost or sale amount at transaction time.
>
> `--cost=conversion`
> : Generate conversion postings to balance the transactions.
>   This is the default for all reports except the `print` report.
>
> `--cost=nocost`
> : Do no conversion of costs.
>   This is the default for the `print` report.
>
> When performing cost conversion and price valuation, hledger will always
> perform cost conversion first, and market price valuations afterwards.

#### Sample tests

```
# 3. --cost=conversion generates conversion postings
hledger -f- print --explicit --cost=conversion
<<<
2011/01/01
    expenses:foreign currency       €100 @ $1.35
    assets
>>>
2011-01-01
    expenses:foreign currency            €100
    equity:conversion:€:$               €-100  ; generated-posting:
    equity:conversion:$:€             $135.00  ; generated-posting:
    assets                           $-135.00

>>>=0

# 4. --cost=conversion with --show-costs continues to show transaction costs
hledger -f- print --explicit --cost=conversion --show-costs
<<<
2011/01/01
    expenses:foreign currency       €100 @ $1.35
    assets
>>>
2011-01-01
    expenses:foreign currency    €100 @ $1.35
    equity:conversion:€:$               €-100  ; generated-posting:
    equity:conversion:$:€             $135.00  ; generated-posting:
    assets                           $-135.00

>>>=0
```

#### User-visible changes

1. The `-B/--cost` flag becomes a flag `-B` which works as before, and an
optional-argument option `--cost[=nocost|cost|conversion]`:

  - `--cost` or `--cost=cost`: works like `-B` (@-priced amounts are converted to cost)
  - `--cost=conversion`: in each @-style entries with no equity postings, 
     adds two equity postings of the form:
     ```
     equity:conversion:FIRSTCOMM:SECONDCOMM    FIRSTCOMMAMT
     equity:conversion:FIRSTCOMM:SECONDCOMM   -SECONDCOMMAMT
     ```
     They are added dynamically (transiently), at report time.
     They are allowed to coexist with the @ price without unbalancing the transaction
     (which they would do if added explicitly by the user).
  - `--cost=nocost`: does neither of the above (ie, nothing)

2. `--cost=conversion` will be the default behaviour of all commands except
   `print`. 
   
#### Interactions / impact / compatibility

1. Commands using `-B` or `--cost` (with no argument) should work as before.

2. In `conversion` mode, all reports should work as they normally would with
   equity style entries.

3. To mimic previous hledger behaviour (don't add equity postings to commodity
   conversions), users will need to add `--cost=nocost` (or, `not:equity:conversion`)
   to commands. This can be seen in the many changes required to hledger's tests.

4. Except with `print`. `print` will have different default behaviour from all
   other commands.

#### Open questions

- Want to avoid hard-coded "equity:conversion"
- Why the :FIRSTCOMM:SECONDCOMM subaccounts, are they worth it ?
- What journal entry variations are handled ?

  - a commodity conversion with other unrelated postings in the transactions
  - one commodity conversion involving more than two postings ?
  - more than one commodity conversions in a transaction ?

- Why is the new feature (`conversion`) integrated with the existing `--cost`
  option ? 
  Because they are closely related, and the combination of cost reporting
  and equity postings is not supported (and not expected in future ?)

- What other names, or other changes, could make this more clear and mnemonic ?
- When should the new mode be made default behaviour ?
- Why is `print` different, and is it worth it ?

### 1554-sm-2

#### Goals / problems tackled

1. Meet the goals of #1554 in a clearer and more compatible way.

#### Differences from 1554

- `-B/--cost` and default behaviour are not changed
- A new flag is added
- The equity conversion account is configurable
- The subaccounts are :FROM:TO, not :FIRST:SECOND.

#### Current draft docs

```
     --infer-equity          in commodity conversion transactions which lack
                             equity postings and rely on @/@@ prices to balance,
                             add the missing equity postings.
```

<!-- #### Sample tests -->

#### User-visible changes

- The `--infer-equity` flag is added (consistent with
  `--infer-market-prices`). It is off by default. In a future release
  it would probably be on by default and there would probably be a
  `--no-infer-equity` to disable it.

- From a conversion from FROMCOMM to TOCOMM, 
  generated equity postings will have the form:
  ```
  EQUITYACCT:FROMCOMM:TOCOMM       -TOCOMMAMT
  EQUITYACCT:TOCOMM:FROMCOMM      FROMCOMMAMT
  ```
  - FROMCOMMAMT is the negative amount, TOCOMMAMT is the positive one
  - FROMCOMM, TOCOMM are the corresponding commodity symbols
  - EQUITYACCT is the first declared subaccount of the first
    highest-level account declared with type Equity, falling back to
    `equity:conversion`. So account declarations might be:
    ```journal
    account equity         ; type:E
    account equity:trades
    account equity:opening balances
    etc..
    ```

   Or, they might be of this simpler form, it's not yet decided:
  ```
  EQUITYACCT:COMMPAIR       -TOCOMMAMT
  EQUITYACCT:COMMPAIR      FROMCOMMAMT
  ```
  - COMMPAIR is the two commodity symbols concatenated in alphabetic order

- In infer equity mode, conversion prices should be used only to infer
  equity postings, and otherwise should not be used for transaction
  balancing. This means that fully explicit entries with both equity
  postings and conversion prices recorded are supported, whether
  manually recorded or inferred.

#### Interactions / impact / compatibility

- There is no change to default behaviour at this stage.

- With `--infer-equity`, `--cost` reports should work as before, using @ conversion prices when they are present.
  Other reports should work as if the equity postings had been recorded manually.

#### Open questions

- What's a better way to specify the conversion account(s) ? Should
  there be a new Conversion or Trade account type, a subtype of
  Equity, and the first account declared with that type is used ?

- How many equity subaccounts are needed ? Is `EQUITYACCT:COMMPAIR` sufficient ?
  Can per-direction reports still be achieved by filtering on amount sign ?

- Should inferred postings be displayed by `print --infer-equity`, or
  only by `print --infer-equity --explicit` ? (`-x/--explicit` is
  required to see other infered things like amounts and prices)

- How much of this applies equally well to currency exchanges, investment purchases, and investment sales, in principle ? 
  How much of that commonality should we expose for best UX ?

- How does this relate to the idea of lot identity, and generating lot subaccounts ?
  Should lot subaccounts exist on the asset(/liability) side, on the equity side, or both ?
