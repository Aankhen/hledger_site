## Environment

The `LEDGER_FILE` environment variable is currently set to `/Users/simon/notes/2019.journal`.
This is done in some super secret way that I'll have to track down, or more likely several ways,
to ensure that it is consistent for:

- programs started from command line in iTerm/Terminal windows
- programs started from emacs shell buffers
- emacs modes such as ledger-mode
- for both text-mode and graphical emacs, whether started from command line or mac GUI (Dock/Finder/Spotlight)
- etc.

## Files

```
$ tree ~/notes
/Users/simon/notes
├── 2019.journal
├── 2019.prices
├── all.journal
├── current.journal -> 2019.journal
├── forecast.journal
...
```

Files are in `~/notes`.
There's one YEAR.journal file per year containing all transactions in date order.
It includes:

- YEAR.prices containing P records for the year
- forecast.journal containing periodic transaction rules

all.journal includes all the year journals. 
It provides all historical data, but is slow, and my old journals are inconsistent/broken, so it's currently rarely used.

current.journal is a symlink for scripts which don't know the year.
Symbolic links are a mixed blessing, causing file path confusion in emacs, eg.

## Data entry

Most journal entries are generated from downloaded CSV:

- Transactions from three banks are aggregated and cleaned in a Google sheet by Tiller ($5/mo).
  A command line tool downloads this sheet as CSV (via cron ? currently disabled).

- Paypal CSV is downloaded manually, then moved into place by a make rule.
  I use Paypal's CSV because Tiller doesn't handle multiple currencies and Paypal's extra metadata fields.

For troubleshooting: when downloading a CSV the previous copy is saved as FILE.csv.old.

```
$ make csv
```

Cash transactions are entered in emacs, using ledger-mode. 
Mostly by copying and pasting similar past transactions.

When rewriting account names, I use either 
ledger-mode completion (`TAB`) or dabbrev-expand completion (`M-/`),
which have different strengths. 

I fetch currency prices with barrucadu's market-prices.py script
([details](https://gist.github.com/simonmichael/9ca4d74b30567dcc3b93763ffe88abf9)).


## Version control

Journal file, included files, makefile and scripts in git.
A mixture of manual and cron-based automatic committing.

## Workflows / Routines

; Recurring (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly..) workflows

### Data entry

#### Downloaded transactions

2021:

- In an iterm3 tab titled FINANCE, I have a TUI emacs with two side-by-side windows.
- In the first window is 2021.journal, with ledger-mode and auto-revert-mode enabled.
- In the second window I switch to a shell and run make Import to download and import latest transactions.
- These show up in the journal right away. I switch focus there, select all the new entries and hit M-q to realign them with ledger-mode (which is better at that).
- I process them one at a time from the top, marking each one cleared (C-c C-e) when it looks good.
- When there's an unknown posting, I:
  - replace the unknown account with the appropriate account (assuming I know it)
  - switch to common.rules in the second window, and search for that account or its parent (assuming it's in the rules somewhere)
  - add some portion of the new entry's description as a new pattern for this account. Or tweak the existing patterns so it will be matched next time (or to avoid over-matching by the wrong rule).
- when all new entries are marked cleared, I git commit the journal and any updated rules file(s). Or if I don't, it will be auto-committed by a nightly cron job, in theory.
- I do this daily-ish, so it's a small number of new txns each time.

#### Manually-entered transactions

For transactions which don't appear in downloaded data (cash transactions, loans, etc.):

- Note it somewhere, anywhere, as quickly possible, or it will be forgotten
  (and I'll have to add an unexplained cash adjustment transaction later).
- If the laptop is out of reach, that will usually be a brief note on
  today's page in a phone notes app (Obsidian, currently) or a paper notebook.
  Later that gets copied to the laptop.
- On the laptop, my usual routine is: 
  - get to the place of data entry
    - iterm3 app (or start it if not running), 
    - FINANCE tab where a TUI emacs (client) is running (or create that tab/start that emacs client), 
    - emacs window showing the journal (or `C-j l` if not showing), 
    - end of buffer (`M->`).
  - add the journal entry: either
    - if short of time: just a commented line, or date and description (and expand it later)
    - if a familiar transaction: search back for a similar one, copy, jump to the end again, paste, adjust as needed (especially the date)
    - otherwise type it in, starting with the date, using ledger-mode's completion (`TAB`),
      or hippie-expand's completion (`M-/`) if they help.
      (ledger-mode required careful configuration for best behaviour with account names,
      the main thing I recall is turn on `ledger-complete-in-steps`.)
    - when the journal entry is finalised, mark it cleared (`C-c C-e`).

## Accounts

; Account hierarchy used, any organisational principles, how I maintain it..

## Reports

I have convenience aliases for hledger commands and reports in `~/notes/bashrc`,
which is automatically sourced by my bash profile.

More reports and file-generating scripts are defined in `~/notes/Makefile`.

Increasingly, I am moving reports and scripts in a (more powerful and robust) Shake file, `~/notes/do.hs`
([details](https://gist.github.com/simonmichael/74f82343b1f625b2861fcf27c3ddeb2f)).
