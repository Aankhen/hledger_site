# Developer docs

Contributor, developer, and project maintenance docs.
These aim to describe and communicate the structure, processes and
workflows of the hledger project - the machine that makes the machine.
Mostly they are UPPERCASE files kept in the main hledger repo,
and symlinked (or rendered by Shake.hs) into the site repo to make them appear as web pages.

Older contributor and dev docs are collected in this large document,
which needs updating so that it provides brief guidance to new contributors:

- [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Dev docs are gradually moving into separate pages, for now at least:

- [README](dev-README.md)
- [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md)
- [BACKLOG](BACKLOG.md)
- [Mockups](mockups.md)
- [ACHIEVEMENTS](ACHIEVEMENTS.md)
- [BENCHMARKS](BENCHMARKS.md)
- [CHANGELOGS](CHANGELOGS.md)
- [CODE](CODE.md)
- [COMMITS](COMMITS.md)
- [CREDITS](CREDITS.md)
- [DOCS](DOCS.md)
- [EXAMPLES](EXAMPLES.md)
- [FUNDING](FUNDING.md)
- [ISSUES](ISSUES.md)
- [MAKE](MAKE.md)
- [PULLREQUESTS](PULLREQUESTS.md)
- [RELEASING](RELEASING.md)
