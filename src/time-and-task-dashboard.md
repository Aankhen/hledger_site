<!-- *2023-12-23: sm makes a cool rube goldberg dashboard with HotKey, Hammerspoon, Terminal, emacs, vterm, just, watchexec, hledger, Obsidian and emojis* -->

SM has invented a cool time and task-tracking aid. As you work on a mac computer (**A**), you wonder how long you have been here and what you should be doing instead. So you press Cmd-Shift-Return to call up your Time and Task Dashboard (**B**). The HotKey app (**C**) recognises your keypress and opens Terminal (**D**), which previously you positioned at top half of screen by pressing Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-Up to trigger a Hammerspoon window layout script (**E**). Inside the Terminal (**D**) is a text-mode Emacs (**F**) which you have split horizontally with Ctrl-x 3 into four side-by-side windows (**G**, **H**, **I** and **J**). In the first window (**G**), a vterm (**K**) is running a `time` script (**L**), which is defined in a justfile (**M**) and uses watchexec (**N**), cron (**O**), hledger (**P**) and various unix tools (**Q**) to show an updating time report (**R**).  You review this to see where you have spent time today, your time goals if any, and how long it has been since you last updated the time log and since the computer woke up. Armed with this information you make any needed updates to your timedot-format time log (**S**), which is in the second window (**H**), usually narrowed to the current day. If you need to run reports or queries, you use the third window (**I**) which contains an emacs shell prompt (**T**). You have also been keeping more detailed notes and todo lists in a weekly notes file (**U**), named like `2023W51.md`, with Obsidian (**V**). To see today's goals and progress summarised, you glance at the fourth window (**J**), where a second vterm is running a `todo` script (**W**), also defined in justfile (**M**), showing an updating tasks report (**X**). This displays the list items from today's section of the weekly notes file (**U**) with empty checkboxes in red, filled checkboxes as green check marks, and non-checkbox bullets as black squares. You review today's green completed tasks, red uncompleted tasks and black unplanned activities. Reoriented and up to date, you press Cmd-Shift-Return again to hide the Terminal (**D**), and proceed with clarity and confidence.

# To force a per minute display as well, have $TIMELOG include a dummy file (.tick)
