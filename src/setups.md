# Example setups

hledger and plain text accounting tools generally are highly flexible
and don't impose much structure or process, 
which sometimes makes it a bit hard to get started. 
Here are some examples of file layouts, account names, workflows and routines that other users have found useful. 
You can try to follow one of these exactly, or simply read for ideas.
