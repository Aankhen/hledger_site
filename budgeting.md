# Budgeting

Here is a start at gathering budgeting-related resources.

- hledger's built-in budget report, [balance --budget](hledger.html#budget-report)
- [Budgeting and forecasting](budgeting-and-forecasting.html), a older introduction to these (written for hledger 1.5 in 2018)
- <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/examples/budgeting> annotated examples of journals implementing budgets
- [Budgeting with hledger](https://gist.github.com/ony/bbec599c0893e676b772559909b81de6), ony's notes on budgeting with auto postings
- <https://plaintextaccounting.org/#budgeting> budgeting-related blogs posts and resources for all PTA tools
