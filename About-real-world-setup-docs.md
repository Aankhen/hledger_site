hledger and plain text accounting tools generally are highly flexible
and don't impose much structure or process. This can make it hard to
get started.

In this part of the site, you can read about file layouts, account
organisations, workflows and routines that have been effective for
other hledger users in practice. You may like to try replicating one
of these exactly, or simply read for ideas.

These docs are not required to be complete, reproducible, or
maintained (although that is welcome), but they should describe setups
or processes that you found useful in practice.

Here's a rough template to provide ideas:
